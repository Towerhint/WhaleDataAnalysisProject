    "## Importing Plotly\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly is a pretty extensive plotting library.  It can be as simple or as complex as you want.  As a result, there are two primary ways of importing Plotly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The easier but less powerful version\n",
    "import plotly.express as px\n",
    "\n",
    "# The more complex but more powerful version\n",
    "import plotly.graph_objects as go\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In an effort to make Plotly more approachable, the developers over at Plotly have created Plotly Express.  Express allows us to create beautiful graphs with Python without having to write as much code.  However, there are some features of Plotly that are not available when using Express.  During those situations, using plotly.graph_objects becomes necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this class, we will be using Plotly Express.  The following concepts covered in this module are using Plotly Express, and are mostly incompatible with Plotly graph objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on Plotly and how to use it with Python, please reference [their website](https://plotly.com/python/).  There are a ton of different plots available with Plotly that we don't have time to cover in this course.    "

    "\n",
    "Additionally, we can pass Pandas data frames into Plotly to generate our scatter plot.  The data frame is the first argument when creating the scatter plot.  We specify `x=` as the data frame column we want to plot along the x-axis.  Then, we can use `y=` to specify the column that we want to plot along the y-axis.  Additionally, we can use the `colors=` argument to create different colors for the scatter plot points depending upon the value in the column.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `hover_data=` argument allows us to have additional data added to each of the points when we hover over the data points.  We pass in a list of the relevant columns into the `hover_data=` argument.  Plotly plots are really nice since they are interactive.  We can zoom into the plot as well as hover over the points to get more information."

Of course, scatterplots, line graphs, histograms, etc. are available, however so are some other neat plots like starburst charts and Sankey Diagrams.
